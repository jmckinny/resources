# Justin's Software Zen

## Break It Up

- Break everything into understandable chucks
  - this lets you isolate where problems are
- Functions should do simple tasks

## Refactor, Refactor, Refactor

- The codebase needs to evolve with the changing needs of the project
- Refactoring can be painful but it can save tons of suffering in the long run

## Plan for the Known

- Create something that works for what you know you need
- Don't add levels of abstraction for future features you don't know if you need
